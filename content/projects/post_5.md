`diff-jjoules` is a tool to be integrated in your continuous integration in order to 
* measure the impact of commits on the energy consumption of the program 
* break the build in case of an energy regression has been detected.

## Install

To use Diff-JJoules, you need to install [JJoules](https://github.com/davidson-consulting/j-joules) and [JUnit-JJoules](https://github.com/davidson-consulting/junit-jjoules).

Then, you can install `diff-jjoules`:

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipTest
```

## Usage

The easiest way to use `diff-jjoules`, you need to clone your project twice: one for the version before applying the 
commit, and one for the version after applying the commit. 
In the following, we consider **path/v1** as the path to the version of the program before applying the commit, and 
**path/v2** as the path to the version of the program after applying the commit.

You can run `diff-jjoules` with the following command line, from **path/v1**, where your `pom.xml` is:

```shell
mvn fr.davidson:diff-jjoules:diff-jjoules -Dpath-dir-second-version=path/v2
```

Calling this maven plugin will apply the whole process as follow:
InstrumentationStepTest
1. `test-selection`: select the tests that execute the code changes (this is done by `diff-test-selection`;
2. [`instrumention`](./doc/instrumentation.md): instrument the selected tests with probes to measure their energy consumption;
3. [`delta`](./doc/delta.md): computation of the energy consumption delta test-wise (&Delta;SEC(t) = SEC(v2,t) - SEC(v1,t));
4. [`mark`](./doc/mark.md): apply a strategy to mark as passing :heavy_check_mark: or failing :x: the commit;
5. [`failer`](./doc/failer.md): instrument the tests that have a positive &Delta, meaning that are consuming energy after applying the commit; 
6. [`suspect`](./doc/suspect.md): run fault localization to rate the modified line according to their suspiciousness;
7. [`report`](./doc/report.md): generate a readable report;

For more information, you can view a dedicated README for each step, however, we advise you to **not** run the steps
individually since they are made to work together.

`Diff-jjoules` offers an extra feature which the mutation of the source code in order to introduce artificial energy 
regression. Please, see the dedicated [`documentation`](./doc/mutation.md) for more information.

## Options

In this section, we list the options that are configurables.
