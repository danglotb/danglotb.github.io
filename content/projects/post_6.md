# Time-Lapse Performance Counters (TLPC) Sensor

TLPC-sensor aims at providing an API to measure various Performance Counters, such as the number of executed intructions and cycles, or energy consumption (with RAPL) in a time-lapse, designed by the call of the function `start()` and `stop()`.

## Install

You need to install [libpfm4](https://github.com/gfieni/libpfm4)
Then, you can run:
```sh
git clone http://github.com/davidson-consulting/tlpc-sensor.git
cd tlpc-sensor && mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./tlpc-sensor
```

You need sudo priviliege and run `echo -1 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid`.

## How to use

:construction:

## Running example

After installing and building `tlpc-sensor`, run it as follow:

```sh
$ ./tlpc-sensor
1 ./tlpc-sensor
Socket created successfully
```

Then, go to the `examples` folder and run:

```sh
make all
```

And run the c version of the client:
```sh
./LWPC
Socket created successfully
start 305235 
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 ...
```

where the number after `start` is the PID of the process.

On the server side, you should see something like:

```sh
Initialize INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED (305235)
Initialize CYCLES (305235)
Initialize RAPL_ENERGY_PKG (305235)
```

Then, in `build/report.json`, you can observe the result:

```json
{
	"RAPL_ENERGY_PKG":851181568,
	"INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED":7841417,
	"CYCLES":2792603
}
```

You can play with the number of iterations of the loop to see the impact on the counters.
