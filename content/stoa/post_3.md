title: "The care and feeding of wild-caught mutants"
date: 2022-01-14
description: " Brown et al. highlight the fact that mutants (changes in source code) in mutation analysis do not necessarily reflect errors made by developers. They propose an approach named wild-caught mutants to generate mutants that reflect errors introduce by developers instead of classic changes. To create those new mutation operators, they use revision of software. They take the reverse (backward) of what is likely to be a correction in the revision history. They have 4 research axes: 1) Does the technique find existing mutations operators? 2) Does the technique find new mutation operations? 3) In what way new mutation operators are different from existing? 4) Does the forward generation is different from the backward generation? Their approach is devised with two tools: mutgen and mutins. The former is responsible to extract new mutation operators from a set of code diffs. Then, the latter apply this new mutation operators to a new code base. Both tools also use a language definition. Mutgen extract candidate mutation operators by analyzing diff between two version of program. It is isolating changes into small block that are contiguous. Each of this block are treated separately. To identify a candidate, changes must not require any synthesise to run its \"after\" state into \"before\" state. After the extraction they filter the candidate using diverse criteria: length of the sequence, candidate that contains repeated specific characters such as \"*\" or \"/\", unbalanced bracket... During this process, they also collect identifier-shift, which are mutation operators that solely change an identifier by another. Mutins attempts to insert mutation operator into another codebase. To do so, it try to match the operators to the token stream. Then, among the matches, it insert the mutants into the code (selected randomly or specified by the user). To evaluate the approach, they use project on github and their history. They used the full revision of the top 50 project, order by the number of forks. They use Mutgen on the 50 projects to create the set of mutation operators. For Mutins, they targeted the program Space(Filippos I. Vokolos and Phyllis G. Frankl. 1998. Empirical Evaluation of the Textual Differencing Regression Testing Technique.). For this program, they generated 5,000 100-cases test-suite. They then compute the number of compiled mutants, and the number of mutant that have been killed. Their approach allows to reproduce four common operators. They identified three stronger mutation operators and two new mutation operators. The wild-caught mutants are as hard to detect that existing (0.81 sampl-based mutation-detection ratio against 0.75 for classical operator). The compatibility is lower 14% against 92% reported by Andrews et al. (J. H. Andrews, L. C. Briand, and Y. Labiche. 2005. Is Mutation an Appropriate Tool for Testing Experiments?). The difference between backward and forward generation is in the number of patches found by the techniques: 6,359 for forward and 5.860 for backward. For the 38 bugs of Space, 7 faults would be reintroduced by backward patches, against only one by both. Five other bugs could be reproduce using the identifier-shift."
