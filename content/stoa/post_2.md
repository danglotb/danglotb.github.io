title: "An Approach to Test Data Generation for Killing Multiple Mutants"
date: 2022-01-14
description: " Mutation analysis is an approximation of fault detection potential of a test suite. Liu et al. aim at generating a \"good\" test suite. To do so, they devise a techniques that generate test data that kills multiple mutants. The idea is that for multiple mutant that are the same location, the constraints to reach them are the same. They improve Constraint Based Testing (CBT) by introduce their Improved Iterative Relaxation Method IIRM. The approach is based on the observation that mutants at the same location (same-location mutants) have the same reachability conditions. The approach use pair-wise test data generation techniques rather than symbolic execution. The approach is done in three steps: 1) collect reachability condition during generation of mutants; 2) combine same-location mutants reachability conditions; 3) program path formations. To express reachability conditions, Authors use branch predicates, instead of execution paths in CBT. There are two main advantages to use branch predicates: 1) there is no need to figure out a path expression to represent all the branch predicates; 2) it is no more necessary to figure out all executions path from the starting points. They compute reachability condition of each mutant while traversing the parse tree of the original program. They push on a stack the branch predicate when the first statement of one block is met, and they pop the top element when the last one is met. To combine reachability condition of same-locations mutants, they distinguish two categories of locations: 1) Several mutation operator can be applied to the location; 2) location with only on mutation operator that produce multiple mutants. For the former case, there is no contradiction in there used mutation operators, they combine them into one condition by conjunction. For the latter case, there is two mutation operators: arithmetic and relational. For arithmetic, there is no contradiction so they combine reachability condition by conjunction. For relationel, there is contradiction. There reduce the combination to two conjunctions. Last but not least, they generate the desired test data by using transforming the combined necessity into branch predicates. They use existing path-wise test data generation to obtain the desired data, i.e. covering the desired path. They evaluate their approach on 5 JAVA programs, ranging from 5 to 21 statements. They applied 5 most frequently mutation operators of their tools, named JUTO. They show that with their approach, they need fewer (20% to 40%) less test data to have almost the same mutation score. Less data generated means less time consumption. "
