For a long time, I wanted to start writing some blog posts. But what about? Then, the idea fell forgotten.
Recently, I did some reviews for Davidson consulting's blog posts which were great and motivate me to start my own!
But the question remains: What about?

I guess that I could start writing about what I am doing. Indeed, Software Energy Consumption is a vast, rich and challenging field.
However, I think that it might be too soon: in my opinion, my maturity on the subject is not yet ready.

Recently, one of my co-contributors, also my thesis' director, suggested performing a release at each new commit on the repository.
So I decided that I will start with what I am doing, but not on my subjects. Rather on peripherical subjects that have a very kind
place in my heart.

The first blog post will be on test-runner, a library that I have written during my thesis, and that, very slowly, spreading among the community.
