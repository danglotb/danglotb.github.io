abstract: "Software bots have gained a significant importance in the modern collaborative development landscape. They provide useful automation and reduce the burden on human developers. Fault localization is the task of locating and ranking potentially buggy lines of code. In this paper, we introduce FLACOCOBOT, a novel type of software bot aimed at automatically providing fault localization information in the development conversation. Whenever a Continuous Integration build fails, FLACOCOBOT presents the developer with potential buggy lines of code, tightly integrated in the development platform GitHub. We have run FLACOCOBOT on 22 active and popular open-source projects hosted on GitHub, demonstrating the feasibility of doing fault localization in the wild. Our research highlights the sheer difficulty of engineering software bots based on execution and dynamic analysis."
