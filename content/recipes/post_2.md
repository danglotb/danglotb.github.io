## Ingredients

* 500g beef
* 500g mushrooms
* 2 onions
* 4 garlic cloves
* 3 tablespoons of a mix mustards
* 1 tablespoon of tomato purée
* 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley
* 1 teaspoon of sea salt
* 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg
* 1 tablespoon of olive oil
* 150ml of beef stock or water

## Recipes

* Slice the onions and mushrooms finely. Slice the beef in long strips. Peel the garlic.
* Add the olive oil to a large pan on high heat. Sear the beef for a minute and set aside.
* In the same pan, add the onion and crushed garlic. Sweat on medium heat for about 5 minutes before adding the mushrooms.
* Cook on medium for about 10 minutes until the mushrooms really reduce in size.
* Add the 3 types of mustard, the tomato puree, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and parsley. Mix well and add the beef. Cook for another 5 minutes on low to medium heat and add the water or beef stock.
* Cook for another 10 minutes on low heat.
* You have the option of adding a splash of vodka at this point. Note that the alcohol will evaporate so there won’t be any alcohol in the final dish!
* Once it looks lovely and creamy, your beef stroganoff is ready! Sprinkle some chopped parsley and enjoy!  This dairy-free lighter version of this classic recipe is absolutely delicious. It works very well with the Jerusalem artichokes with salsa verde.
