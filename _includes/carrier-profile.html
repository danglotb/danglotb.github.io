        - <span class="project-tagline">Software Testing AMPlification: is funded European Commission - H2020. STAMP works in DevOps and agile methods and aims at improving the value of testing at different step of the application's lifecycle.
        Behind STAMP, there are 3 main activities:
        <ol>
            <li>Unit test amplification: exploiting existing unit test to generate better variants or new test method that improve the overall test suite's quality, <i>e.g.</i> increase the branch coverage.</li>
            <li>Configuration amplification: exploiting existing configuration test to create variants and execute the application in various configurations before production.</li>
            <li>Production amplification: exploiting production information to achieve specific tasks such as crash reproduction.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            My research is mostly focuses on unit test amplification. I am exploiting existing test methods to create variants to increase the mutation score, detects automatically behavioral change, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            My work takes place within this project and is applied directly to the partners' code base.
            During my research, I develop strong prototypes and apply several software engendering methods: agility, unit testing, continuous integration, pull request development, bug tracker, etc.

        - <span class="project-tagline">DSpot is a test suite amplifier.
        It takes as input a project and its test suite and will produce test cases according to a test criterion adequacy such as branch coverage or mutation score.
        I am currently the main contributor to DSpot. DSpot is the skeleton that support all my research to validate and experiment my proposed approach.
