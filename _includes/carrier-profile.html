            Development of a social network to bind together people looking for job opportunities, companies looking for specific profiles and training centers offering courses.
            In the context of an initiative by Pole Emploi, 26 interns have been selected for a special program offering them a complete Fullstack developer training during 3 months. 
            After these 3 months of courses, I joined them to build the first prototype of this social network.
            I lead the group, being the product owner and the scrum master during 5 weeks.
            The source code is avalaible in open-source <a href='https://github.com/Bootcamp2020/skillful_network'>here</a>(FR).
            Today, I pursue the developement of this social network.

            I am also a member of ADAVEC, a french project.
            This project aims at building a prototype to allow autononous vehicle to adapt continuously its level of autonomy according to the traffic and the security.
            This prototype will define automatically the optiomal level of autonomy by communucating with the environnement (V2X, ADAS,…), 
            and also by analyzing the ability of the driver to ensure the take over of the vehicle.
