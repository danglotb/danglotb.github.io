            - <span class="project-tagline">DSpot is a test suite amplifier.
            It takes as input a project and its test suite and will produce test cases according to a test criterion adequacy such as branch coverage or mutation score.
            I am currently the main contributor to DSpot. DSpot is the skeleton that support all my research to validate and experiment my proposed approach.

            - <span class="project-tagline">Test-runner is a library that allows developer to execute test in a new and clean JVM. After some months to develop research prototypes in Software engineering, I noticed that I always re-develop some classes to execute the test: automatic-repair based on test, test amplification, etc. I thought that this was sad to reinvent the wheel that is why I decide to create this open-source library, to join the effort in the development of reliables test execution in research prototypes in Java, and save times for researchers.</span>
