          Development of a social network to bind together people looking for job opportunities, companies looking for specific profiles and training centers offering courses.
          In the context of an initiative by Pole Emploi, 26 interns have been selected for a special program offering them a complete Fullstack developer training during 3 months.
          After these 3 months of courses, I joined them to build the first prototype of this social network.
          I lead the group, being the product owner and the scrum master during 5 weeks.
          The source code is available in open-source <a href='https://github.com/Bootcamp2020/skillful_network'>here</a>(FR).

          I was also a member of ADAVEC, a french project.
          This project aims at building a prototype to allow autonomous vehicles to continuously adapt its level of autonomy according to the traffic and the security.
          This prototype will define automatically the optimal level of autonomy by communicating with the environment (V2X, ADAS,…),
          and also by analyzing the ability of the driver to ensure the take over of the vehicle.

               Software Testing AMPlification (STAMP): is funded European Commission - H2020. STAMP works in DevOps and agile methods and aims at improving the value of testing at different step of the application's lifecycle.
           </p>
            Behind STAMP, there are 3 main activities:
            <ol>
                <li>Unit test amplification: exploiting existing unit test to generate better variants or new test method that improve the overall test suite's quality, <i>e.g.</i> increase the branch coverage.</li>
                <li>Configuration amplification: exploiting existing configuration test to create variants and execute the application in various configurations before production.</li>
                <li>Production amplification: exploiting production information to achieve specific tasks such as crash reproduction.</li>
            </ol>

                My research is mostly focused on unit test amplification. I am exploiting existing test methods to create variants to increase the mutation score, detects automatically behavioral change, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work takes place within this project and is applied directly to the partners' code base.
                During my research, I develop strong prototypes and apply several software engendering methods: agility, unit testing, continuous integration, pull request development, bug tracker, etc.

            <p>Exploring the Perturbability Envelope in Software:</p>
            <p>Perturbation is change in the state of a system at runtime. Such changes has a surprisingly low impact on the correctness (final output) of system according to our study.
                Does the equilibrium of the correctness of software is naturally present? </p>
